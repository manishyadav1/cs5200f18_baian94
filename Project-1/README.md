## Submission Instructions:

## Submission Deadline: Sunday September 16, 2018 at 11:59PM

### Updated Submission Guidelines
* Please do not submit your spring boot application. Only Add a file called *URLs.txt* to your repository which will consist of all the AWS urls:
>* http://cs5200-spring2018-annunziato.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
>* http://cs5200-spring2018-annunziato.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/hello/string
>* http://cs5200-spring2018-annunziato.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/hello/object


## GIT Submission:
Students who are not familiar with git, please follow the below steps to submit your work to the repository.

* Perform a GIT Pull to make sure who have the up-to-date changes.
> git pull

* If there is an update, git pull also performs a merge with the local working branch (if you are not familiar with branching in git, your working repository is always on 'master' branch unless changed and any merge performed by pull operation will merge into the master branch.)

* Copy the three files stated above into your Assignment-1 folder, if they don't exist there already.

* Change your current working directory to Assignment-1 and perform a git add operation.
>"git add \*" or "git add filename1 filename2 filename3"

* The files are now staged to your git instance located in your working tree directory.

* Without changing your working directory, perform git commit operation.
> git commit -m <Message of your choice>

* Now the final step!
* By still remaining in the same working directory, perform a git push operation.
> git push

### If your steps didn't produce any errors, your Submission is complete and await for your Submission scores. The scores will be released within a week from the Submission.
