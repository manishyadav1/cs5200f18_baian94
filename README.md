# Welcome to CS5200
## This course introduces relational database management systems as a class of software systems and prepares students to be sophisticated users of database management systems.

## Assignments
Submissions will be made via Blackboard and GITHub Organization accounts, to which the students will be given access to. Each assignment will have instructions on what to submit, but generally students are expected
* To commit their project/assignment/homework in their GITHub account.
* Submit their github url to their Blackboard account.
* Mandatorily provide instructions on how to execute their work in README.md document.

Code is expected to be professional and properly documented
* Any required data files and library dependencies must be resolvable via pom.xml or package.json files.
* All source code must be available through the school's github repository.
* Instructors must be able to clone your repository, build, and run your project from their local environments.

This class has very strict standards for borrowing code:
* if you borrow anything for use in your assignment/project, you must have a citation. A good guideline is that if you take more than three lines of code from some source, you must include the information on where it came from. A URL or a notation (e.g., "MATLAB help files") is fine.
* If it is an entire function, note it at the beginning of the code segment and include any original credit information. Provide a qualitative description of what you used, and what you changed/contributed.
* If you have a question about what is considered a violation of this policy, ASK!
